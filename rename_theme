To rename an existing theme in place:
 - Ensure you have saved and closed all files and tools (PHPStorm, etc) and are up-to-date with Git.
 - Rename the theme directory using the client_theme_creator formula, for example pcip_theme_ts.
 - Rename the theme's .info file.
 - Update the site's .profile.
 - Do a full site search for themes/custom and update the theme name.
 - Do a full site search for 'old_theme_name' (with single quotes!), edit as appropriate.
 - Update all function names in the theme's template.php file.
 - Update paths in Google migration documents.
 - Commit changes - git should show a large number of rename themes/custom{old_theme => new_theme} messages.
 - Rebuild site.
 - Review Context to find any theme-based conditions.
